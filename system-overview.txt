4. Key Features Explained
Smart Contract Matching
When you go to assign a contract to a vehicle, the system is smart about what it shows you:
* Only shows contracts that fit that vehicle
* If the customer has a 2023 Honda Accord, you'll only see contracts that include:
   * Honda (make), OR
   * Accord (model), OR
   * 2023 (year), OR
   * Any combination of these
This prevents mistakes like accidentally selling a Honda contract to a Ford owner.
Service Status Tracking
The system always shows you what's available:
* Green/Available: Services ready to use
* Used: Shows the date it was used
* Fulfilled: All services used, contract complete
* Expired: Contract past expiration date
Contract Statuses Explained
* Active Unpaid: Contract assigned but payment not yet received
* Active Paid: Payment received, services can be used
* Pending: Contract created through external system, needs approval
* Fulfilled: All services used (automatic)
* Void: Contract cancelled, no services can be used
* Canceled: Contract terminated
Search & Dashboard
The main dashboard makes it easy to find anything:
* Search for customers by name, phone, email, or customer number
* Search for vehicles by VIN
* Search for contracts by contract number
* See at-a-glance summaries:
   * How many active contracts you have
   * How many are pending
   * Revenue totals

7. Integration with Other Software (API)
What This Means for You
Other software systems your dealership uses (like Darwin in Finance) can talk to this system automatically.
The Rating Feature - Quote Rating API Endpoint
When someone else's software asks: "What maintenance packages do you have for a 2023 Honda Accord?"
Our system responds with:
* All matching contract packages
* Prices and terms
* What services are included
* This lets them quote customers in their system
The Purchase Feature - Purchase API Endpoint
When someone buys a contract through another system:
* That system sends the customer and vehicle info to us
* We automatically create the customer profile
* We add their vehicle
* We assign the contract
* We generate a PDF of the contract
* Status starts as "Pending" for you to review and approve
The Void Feature - Void Cancel API Endpoint
When a contract needs to be cancelled:
* External system sends cancellation request
* We mark the contract as "Void"
* All logged automatically
How This Helps You
* Less manual data entry
* Fewer mistakes from retyping information
* Seamless integration with partners
* Automatic record keeping

8. PDF Contract Documents

* Customer details

* Terms and conditions
* Who sold the contract
Customization
Administrators can customize the PDF template:

10. Common Questions
Q: What if I enter the wrong VIN? A: You can edit vehicle information at any time. Just go to the vehicle and click "Edit."
Q: Can I delete a customer? A: The system uses "soft delete" - the customer is hidden but data is retained for records and reports.
Q: What if I mark a service as used by mistake? A: Contact your administrator - they can correct this in the database. This prevents accidental changes but allows for corrections.
Q: Can contracts be transferred between vehicles? A: No, contracts are tied to specific vehicles. You would need to void the old contract and create a new one.
Q: What happens when a contract expires? A: The system doesn't automatically change status based on date, but you can filter reports by date to see expired contracts. Services can still be marked as used if they came in before expiration.
Q: Can I have multiple contracts on one vehicle? A: Yes! A vehicle can have multiple active contracts - for example, a maintenance contract and an extended warranty.
Q: How do I know which contracts apply to which vehicles? A: The system handles this automatically. When you go to assign a contract, it only shows you contracts that match the vehicle's make, model, or year.
Q: Can I see who sold each contract? A: Yes! The system tracks who assigned each contract, and this information appears in reports.
Q: What if our contract packages change? A: You can create new contract templates at any time. Old contracts keep their original terms, but new sales use the new template.
Q: Can I bulk import customers? A: This can be added as a future enhancement. Initially, customers are added one at a time or through the external API.
